## Spatial distibution of Airbnbs and other accommodation types in Edinburgh

Airbnb listings for Edinburgh come from the website Inside Airbnb, which publishes freely available listings of all Airbnb properties in selected cities [http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html]

Other accommodation data comes from OpenStreetMap via Geofabkrik \cite{RefWorks:doc:5cc01dd9e4b0873afb8e7c79}. Points of interest (including attractions) come from the Ordnance Survey (OS) and were obtained via the Edina Digimap service [https://digimap.edina.ac.uk/].

The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation and Data Zone boundaries and statistics come from the Scottish Government \cite{RefWorks:doc:5cc024d0e4b04373cde486be}.

The Airbnb listings data includes capacity but it was not possible to obtain capacity for other accommodation. Instead, average capacity for other accommodation was derived using data from a recent industry report \cite{RefWorks:doc:5cbc43b6e4b0fdb4255db258}.
